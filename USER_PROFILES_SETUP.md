# User Profiles Feature Setup Guide (Phase 2)

This guide will help you set up the user profiles feature for your Countries Next.js application. This is Phase 2 of the implementation, building on top of the favourites feature from Phase 1.

## Prerequisites

- ✅ Phase 1 (Favourites feature) must be completed first
- ✅ Supabase project with authentication enabled
- ✅ Environment variables configured from Phase 1

## Phase 2: User Profiles Feature Implementation

### 1. Database Setup

Run the SQL commands in `supabase-profiles-setup.sql` in your Supabase SQL Editor:

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the contents of `supabase-profiles-setup.sql`
4. Run the query

This will create:

- `user_profiles` table with proper structure
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies for profiles
- Automatic profile creation trigger on user signup
- Necessary indexes for performance
- Username uniqueness constraints

### 2. Storage Setup (CRITICAL - Required for Avatar Uploads)

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: You must create the storage bucket or avatar uploads will fail!

**Option A: Via Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)**

1. Go to **Storage** in your Supabase dashboard
2. Click **"Create a new bucket"**
3. Set **Name**: `avatars`
4. **Enable "Public bucket"** ✅ (critical for avatar access)
5. Optional: Set file size limit to 5MB

**Option B: Via SQL (Automated)**
The updated `supabase-profiles-setup.sql` now includes bucket creation. Just run the SQL file and it will create everything automatically.

**Storage Policies** (automatically created by SQL):

```sql
-- Allow authenticated users to upload their own avatars
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload own avatar" ON storage.objects
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
    bucket_id = 'avatars' AND
    auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
  );

-- Allow public access to view avatars
CREATE POLICY "Avatar images are publicly accessible" ON storage.objects
  FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'avatars');

-- Allow users to update their own avatars
CREATE POLICY "Users can update own avatar" ON storage.objects
  FOR UPDATE USING (
    bucket_id = 'avatars' AND
    auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
  );

-- Allow users to delete their own avatars
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete own avatar" ON storage.objects
  FOR DELETE USING (
    bucket_id = 'avatars' AND
    auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
  );
```

```
src/
├── app/
│   ├── api/
│   │   └── profile/
│   │       ├── route.js              # Profile CRUD endpoints
│   │       └── avatar/

└── lib/
    └── features/
        └── profile/
            └── profileSlice.js       # Redux slice for profiles
```

### 7. Environment Variables

No additional environment variables are required beyond Phase 1. The existing Supabase configuration handles both favourites and profiles.

### 8. Avatar Upload Specifications

- **Supported Formats**: JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP
- **Maximum Size**: 5MB per image
- **Storage**: Supabase Storage bucket (`avatars`)

- user_id: UUID (Foreign Key to auth.users, Unique)
- username: TEXT (Unique, Optional)
- display_name: TEXT
- avatar_url: TEXT
- bio: TEXT
- created_at: TIMESTAMP
- updated_at: TIMESTAMP
```

### 10. API Endpoints

- **Navigation**: Profile link appears for authenticated users
- **Redux Store**: Shares the same store with other features

### 12. Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues

1. **"Failed to create profile"**

   - Ensure the user_profiles table exists
   - Check RLS policies are properly configured
   - Verify the auto-creation trigger is active

2. **"Username is already taken"**

   - Username must be unique across all users
   - Try a different username

3. **Avatar upload fails**

   - Ensure the `avatars` storage bucket exists
   - Check file size (max 5MB) and type (image formats only)
   - Verify storage RLS policies are configured

4. **Profile not loading**
   - Check authentication status
   - Verify API routes are accessible
   - Check browser console for errors

### 13. Testing the Feature

1. **Login** to the application
2. **Navigate** to the Profile page via the navigation menu
3. **Edit Profile** by clicking the "Edit Profile" button
4. **Upload Avatar** by clicking the camera icon
5. **Update Information** (display name, username, bio)
6. **Save Changes** and verify updates persist

### 14. Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements:
